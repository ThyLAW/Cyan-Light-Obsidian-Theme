# Cyan-Light Obsidian Theme

## Theme

This theme is a gray/blue mix theme that is sometimes referred to as "Cyan-Light". I enjoy the color of gray chosen as it easier on the eyes and it is not dark which some people may not like. It is hard to mix in true cyan as it would be too bright, so I opted for a cooler cyan-blue.

## Install

To install, simply navigate to your **vault**. Inside, drag and drop the `cyan-light theme.css` file into: `\.obsidian\themes`

Then, **open** the Obsidian application and go to Settings => Appearence => Theme and select **cyan-light theme**

## Obsidian

[Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) is a really cool note taking and mind-mapping software that is powered through the use of **markdown**.

This software also allows you to modify your CSS files to give it a custom look.
